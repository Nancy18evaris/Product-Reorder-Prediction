This project involves building a Deep Learning model to predict product reordering behavior by users. The aim is to identify patterns in purchasing habits and predict whether a product will be reordered in the next purchase cycle. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model deployment using Streamlit.

🧼 DATA PREPROCESSING 

Missing Values: Handled using MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) for robust estimation.
Outlier Detection: Outliers were identified and treated based on domain logic and distribution analysis.
Collinearity Check: Multicollinearity among features was checked and mitigated to prevent redundancy.
Top Products Filter: The top 25 products were selected based on reorder frequency for focused modeling.
Sampling: Dataset size was reduced using sampling techniques to optimize model training time and resource usage.

📊 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Performed comprehensive EDA to understand:
Product-wise reorder frequency,
Department and aisle contribution to reorder,
User behavior and patterns over time,
Correlation between engineered features.

🛠️ FEATURE ENGINEERING

Extracted meaningful features from product, department, and aisle names.
Applied OneHotEncoding to categorical variables:
product_name,
department_name,
aisle_name.
Scaled numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
